# Introduction to Bayesian Data Analysis

Authors: Nicle Cruz and Julia Haaf

## Description
This course is an introduction to Bayesian modeling, oriented towards linguists and psychologists. Topics to be covered: Introduction to Bayesian data analysis, Linear Modeling, Hierarchical Models, and Bayes factors. We will cover these topics within the context of an applied Bayesian workflow that includes exploratory data analysis, model fitting, and model checking using prior and posterior predictive checks.

## Prerequisites
Participants are expected to be familiar with frequentist methodology (what is taught in the foundations course, see below, as well as this online textbook: here), be relatively fluent in `R` usage, and must have some experience in data analysis, particularly with the `R` library `lme4`. Basic high school (pre-calculus) arithmetic and mathematical fluency is assumed; for example, you should know what a log is, what an exponent is, and be able to solve for y in $x=log(y/(1-y))$. If you are unfamiliar with frequentist methods, we suggest taking the introductory frequentist course listed below.
